        Get started with jCore, the world's most complete frontend single page framework
        for building responsive, mobile-first sites and applications with my
        jCore project skeleton and library of jBlock components.
    </h5>
    <p>
        I built jCore to be a complete single page frontend framework that
        makes developing web applications easier by leveraging the simplicity of
        jQuery and Foundation and an application architecture inspired by .Net MVC's
        master pages and Vue's page templates.
